# installation
  - clone this repo
  - run `npm i` to install dependencies
  - run `npm run build` to compile the typescript files
  - Congrats!

# updating
  So, you should have typescript installed, so let's continue
  - run `npm run clean` to remove your current compiled JS files
  - run `npm run build` to compile the typescript files
  - Congrats!
  
# prebuilt 
Please build it yourself, making a prebuilt would be problematic due to frequent updates


# security
Please, if you wan't to share this with someone, send him the GitHub repo link, NEVER send him an archive with all the data especially `auth`, this folder contains data used to authenticate with Vulcan UONET+ API, and giving it to someone makes possible to the second user get your personal information, school that you are going to, etc.

# contribution
