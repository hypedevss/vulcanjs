# prebuilt 
Please build it yourself, making a prebuilt would be problematic due to frequent updates


# security
Please, if you wan't to share this with someone, send him the GitHub repo link, NEVER send him an archive with all the data especially `auth`, this folder contains data used to authenticate with Vulcan UONET+ API, and giving it to someone makes possible to the second user get your personal information, school that you are going to, etc.
